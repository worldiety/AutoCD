# Documentation AutoCD

## Usage
What is AutoCD and what can it do for me?
Docker and Kubernetes are everywhere, everybody wants to use it but it is
not always simple to write a fitting docker file that satisfies all constrains.
Even though it would be possible do generate an image by coping and pasting
all the bits you might need, the chance of an error are not insignificant.
To prevent errors like that and to make docker/kubernetes more accessible
we created AutoCD.

AutoCD helps you to get your project ready for your k8s cluster.
The program will automatically generate a fitting docker image and deploy
that to your cluster. Therefor AutoCD detects the project language
(Java 8+, Go, Vue.js, Node.js are supported) and uses the matching,
predefined docker image (if there is none found within your root folder),
to deploy the project to your cluster. It can also take down old, not used
projects from the cluster.
All you have to do to use AutoCD is, to include it into your gitlab-ci.yml
file and, if you have one, include a JSON file for configure AutoCD.
The JSON file allows you to make specific changes to the configuration
(e.g. port, volumes).

The latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/worldiety/AutoCD/releases/latest/download/AutoCD.jar).

## Installation
If you want to integrate AutoCD to your project, you need to adjust the
gitlab-ci.yml.
Add the following to the _.script_ option.
```bash
  script:
    - curl -L https://github.com/worldiety/AutoCD/releases/latest/download/AutoCD.jar -o app.jar
    - java -jar app.jar ${KUBE_URL} ${KUBE_TOKEN} ${KUBE_CA_PEM_FILE} ${BUILDTYPE}
```
This will download and execute the AutoCD tool. All other variables
will be obtained from your global GitLab configuration.
The final configuration should look like this:
```bash
image: fredlahde/dind-java
services:
  - docker:dind

variables:
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""

stages:
  - deploy-prod
  - deploy-dev

.deploy:
  stage: deploy
  before_script:
    - apk add curl
    - apk add git
    - git --no-pager show $(git log --pretty=format:'%h' -n 2 | tail -n 1):autocd.json 2>/dev/null 1>oldautocd.json || true
  environment: default #Needed for CI to autopopulate KUBE_ fields
  tags:
    - docker-build-runner
  script:
    - curl -L https://github.com/worldiety/AutoCD/releases/latest/download/AutoCD.jar -o app.jar
    - java -jar app.jar ${KUBE_URL} ${KUBE_TOKEN} ${KUBE_CA_PEM_FILE} ${BUILDTYPE}

deploy-prod:
  extends: .deploy
  stage: deploy-prod
  variables:
    BUILDTYPE: prod
  only:
    - master

```
#### JSON configuration file example

```
## Environment
To run the autoCD.jar, Java 12 is necessary.
Variables, for example KUBE_URL, KUBE_TOKEN, KUBE_CA_PEM_FILE, BUILDTYPE
should be set in your GitLab deployment variables. You do not need to worry about these, since they are created by 
GitLab when establishing a cluster or linking your GitLab instance to an already existing cluster. Therefore they have 
nothing to do with the AutoCD tool directly. If you want to learn more about kubernetes and Gitlab, please refer to the
official [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/#deployment-variables).



## Important Notes
* The parameter class 'volume' has parameters of its own:
    * _volumeMount_: name of the Volume
    * _volumeSize_: size string from k8s (e.g. 1Gi, 100Mi)
    * _folderPermission_: permissions within the folder
    * _retainVolume_: boolean value with determines if the volume should be retained after a restart

* If AutoCD finds any file named '_build.sh_' within your project rood folder, AutoCD will use the build.sh file you
 provide. If there is none, AutoCD will use a default build.sh file. However, after executing the build.sh, AutoCD
 expects a compiled project with fitting files (e.g. yourProject.jar inside of /build/libs if it's a Java project).

* If there is any need for static data (e.g. images, fonts) make sure, that those files are located within the **static**
folder (folder must be named **static**) inside your project root directory. AutoCD will make sure, that the static folder
will be copied onto the pod and available at the working directory.
